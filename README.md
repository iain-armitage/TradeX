# TradeX Technologies (Starter Template)

This is the initial boilerplate for your TradeX SaaS platform built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: version 16.14 or later is recommended to build and run the application.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to view the app. You should see a sidebar with navigation links, a top bar titled "Dashboard", and a welcome message in the main area.

## Deployment to Vercel

1. [Sign up for Vercel](https://vercel.com) and install the Vercel CLI if desired.
2. Push this repository to your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
3. In the Vercel dashboard, import your repository and follow the prompts. Vercel automatically installs dependencies and runs `npm run build`.
4. After deployment completes, your TradeX instance will be available at the generated Vercel URL.
